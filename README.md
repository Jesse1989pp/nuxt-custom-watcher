# Nuxt custom watcher

Extend the nuxt watcher with custom files.
The module will add options to nuxt config to fill up an array of files to watch.

### Personal issue resolved

In a personal project we used multiple layers and config. These files didn't retrigger a reload.

### Kick app

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
